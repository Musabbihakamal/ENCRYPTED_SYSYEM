📋 Project Overview
This is a beginner-friendly Streamlit project that allows users to securely store and retrieve data using a passkey.
It uses basic encryption (Caesar cipher) and password hashing (SHA-256).
The system operates completely in memory without needing any external database.

🎯 Features
Store secret data securely with a unique passkey.

Retrieve and decrypt data by entering the correct passkey.

After 3 wrong attempts, the user is redirected to a login page.

Simple Login system for reauthorization.

All data is stored temporarily during the session (no database).

🔧 Technologies Used
Python 3

Streamlit (for UI)

Hashlib (for passkey hashing)

⚙️ How It Works
On the Home Page, user can:

Store new data

Retrieve existing data

To Store Data:

Enter secret text and a passkey.

Data is encrypted and saved with a hashed passkey.

To Retrieve Data:

Enter the stored passkey.

If correct, data is decrypted and displayed.

If wrong, failed attempts are counted.

After 3 failed attempts → redirect to Login Page.

Login Page:

Enter Username: admin

Enter Password: admin123

After successful login, user can continue again.
